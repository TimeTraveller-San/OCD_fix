# Readberserk fix
http://readberserk.com/ 
is a great website for reading one of my favorite manga. But a few things really bothered me:-
- disqus: disqus comments at the end of each chapter were really oboxious, i had to get rid of them, they were subtly enforcing change in my opinions
- dark theme: White background color isn't good for my eyes, instead of simply using dark firefox reader i rather made a one-liner CSS fix for it
-[NEW] they added a new permanent green ugly bar at the top saying "subscibe with email to get updates" it's ugly and catchy, its going away

## Installataion
