# MPV keybinding update
I love mpd. I think it's the best media player ever made but I've been using vlc for most of my life. I am used to vlc's keybindings.
Majorly I want to control audio level with scroll wheel. 

~/.config/mpv/input.conf
```
MOUSE_BTN3 add volume 2
MOUSE_BTN4 add volume -2
```

Doing this will fix it.
