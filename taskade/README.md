# Taskade
I use [](https://www.taskade.com/) very often.


I have installed its extension on my browser and have replaced the newtab screen with it.


Despite all this, they won't allow me to put a custom image in the background. It's a "premium feature" they say. I can't tolerate those ugly default backgrounds. They bother me, they bother me a lot. Hence, I edit the css with a single line js script install-able using tampermonkey.


Note: I do not know how to write js. I just google stuff and paste it. This is how I have made everything I have in js. I hate js.
