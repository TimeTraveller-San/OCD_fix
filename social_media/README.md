# Social Media Fix
- I am addicted to checking out facebook again and again
- I often click on various stuff that appears on my facebook feed
- I don't like to see "stories" on both facebook and whatsapp, they're clickbaits that I often can't resist
- I often open youtube to look for something specific but end up clicking on something on the home page feed. What's worse, even youtube introduced something called "stories" which pisses me of to no limit
- I want to use youtube to only watch what I want to watch and not munch on carefully chosen stuff that youtube's machine learning algorithm throws my way to keep me addicted. I want to control my computer not vice versa. 
- There would be no need to resist if it doesn't exist
- These websites keep updating hence this script needs to be updated often too
- I will try to write a Machine Learning algorithm that would automatically search and delete such "addicting" social media elements and hence I won't have to hardcode this anymore.

This simple tapermonkey script deletes my facebook feed, stories and also removes youtube feed (Install using tampermonkey)
